    desc: `Biomaterials, or biologically growing materials from the bottom-up is a central theme at the Bio-Integrated Design Lab. A wide range of lab-based investigations are conducted in order to develop suitable environments that would induce controlled, but rapid and efficient growth of specific living organisms such as microalgae, cyanobacteria and mycelium. The growth parameters of the specific bioreactors are then translated via architectural design tools, in order to augment novel biomaterials for large-scale applications within the built environment.

    Primarily, three broad approaches are explored. The first, where biomaterials are grown within controlled environments into desired morphologies, later to be assembled to create macroscale structures. The second is the preparation and construction of biomaterials, that induce or support the growth of other microscopic organisms within their permeable environments; allowing the active biomaterial to respond to the changing environmental conditions, in turn impacting its biological processes. And the third is the creation of very specific growth conditions within the external environment that can, over a period-of-time allow the seeding, propagation and colonisation of roots and flowers of higher plant species to support biodiversity within the built environment.`,

    desc: `Biosynthesis is the production of complex compounds from simpler precursors in a living organism. A phenomenon abundantly observed in processes such as photosynthesis, and chemosynthesis. The projects under this category explore different ways of designing and fabricating micro-environments that can help host and propagate complex biological conditions from relatively simpler precursor cultures. 

    For instance, plant tissue culture is embedded into designed, biocompatible scaffolds to allow the emergence of new life forms though regulating paths of dedifferentiation and differentiation in callus tissues. Hydrogel vascular circulation systems within micro-structural scaffolds are architecturally designed to support the plant tissue growth as it expresses cell multiplication to grow into a diversity of new plant formations.
    
    Additionally, organisms such as cyanobacteria, microalgae and bacteria are also investigated for their ability to adapt, and evolve within other granular substrates such as sand, creating biofilms in response to the organism’s biosynthetic activity within a very specific urban context.
    
    Multiple computational simulations, and robotic extrusion techniques are explored to weave the desired vascular, living microenvironments into macroscale dimensions intentionally introducing complex tissue cultures into architectural-scale morphologies.`,

    desc: `Biohybrid scaffolds are explored, with varying combinations of existing materials such as textiles and ceramics to host biofilms such as P.purpureum, that have the ability to uptake contaminants such as microplastics from polluted water via bioaccumulation. These are further designed computationally into 3D porous structures allowing us to introduce the scaffolds within the existing urban context. `,

    name: "Bioreceptivity",
    desc: `The bioengineer Olivier Guillitte defined the term bioreceptivity as ‘the aptitude of a material (or any other inanimate object) to be colonised by one or several groups of living organisms without necessarily undergoing any biodeterioration.’

    The projects in this category explore the potentials of introducing elements such as porosity, humidity/moisture, permeability as key parameters to existing building materials increasing passive vegetative growth in architecture, responding to the urgency of the current climate crisis by improving the environmental quality of cities. The aim is to promote self-regulated biological systems directly on building façades and urban infrastructures, integrating poikilohydric species (algae, mosses, lichens) that switch on and off their photosynthetic activity without the need for additional mechanical irrigation and maintenance, while also creating a new design aesthetic for ageing buildings.`,

    name: "Bioregeneration",
    desc: `While designing and fabricating with grown, biologically active materials is one aspect of the workflow at Bio-ID Lab. Being able to regenerate with waste products, is an equally important aspect of creating a circular, intertwined, biological loop.

    A novel biomaterial composite is prepared from food waste, and organic binders; and a series of material tests are conducted in order to fine-tune the biological, chemical, mechanical, and degradable properties of the material. A material-driven robotic extrusion system is developed to facilitate the successful scale-up of structurally stable prototypes. Different stages of wetness, and dryness of the food-composite material are in particularly explored through geometric variations.
    
    Another element is the generation of energy, in the form of electrons emitted via a biological process. Small-scale microbial fuel cells are designed for integration within remote sites where access to energy is scarce, or completely absent. Demonstrating the different applications, a biological system can perform, provided they are designed and integrated within an appropriate scale and context.`,

    desc: `The projects exhibited under this category explore a variety of digital-generative tools with the intention of translating and optimising the lab-based material studies, into larger-scale prototypes which can be seamlessly fabricated using advanced techniques of fabrication.

    Standard objects, such as the Pantone chair are re-imagined with more sustainable biomaterial composites, requiring geometrical transformations to achieve the desired mechanical and functional properties. Geometrical analysis from engineering software are used to test material deformations, coupled with a customized, generative form-finding algorithm to achieve the re_designed output. This phase of the project is focused on the famous Panton Chair, manufactured with Thermoplastics.
    
    Additionally, sensors are developed and integrated into the design workflow, introducing an element of responsiveness and communication between the designed scaffold and the varying environmental parameters in its surroundings, such as light, humidity, air, temperature and pH.
