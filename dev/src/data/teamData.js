  intro:
    "Our urban habitat today is being fundamentally influenced by revolutions in biotechnology, computation and our exposure to the long-lasting effects of climate change. Bio-Integrated Design takes these life-changing phenomena as the foundation to explore radical, sophisticated, yet also critical, design solutions that will shape our future society. Nature plays a central role in the programme, beyond that of a model or inspiration, it is the medium of a new multi-layered design approach that is biologically, materially and socially integrated.
